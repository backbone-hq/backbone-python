**Notice: Temporary Removal of Python SDK**

Dear Backbone users,

We regret to announce that due to Backbone's swift pace of development, our alpha-grade Python SDK has unfortunately fallen behind and is no longer compatible with the Backbone API service.

In light of this situation, we have decided to remove the incompatible Python SDK code from this repository temporarily. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this might cause you and your projects. Rest assured, our team is working diligently to develop an updated release-grade version of the Python SDK that will be fully compatible with the Backbone API service. We will publish this updated version as soon as it becomes available.

We understand that this may be disappointing, but we assure you that this decision was made with the best interest of our users in mind. Our goal is to provide a seamless and debugging-free experience for all Backbone users, and we are committed to resolving this issue as quickly as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us here on GitHub or through our community channels. We value your feedback and will do our best to assist you during this transitional period.
